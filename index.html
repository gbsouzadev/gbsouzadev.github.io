        <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
        <div class="article-content">
          <p>Let me tell you a few reasons why I want to became a software engenieer:</p>
          <p>1. I just love to spend time in front of a computer. That's is my natural habbitat...</p>
          <p>2. There are endless things you can do, create and improve around you in your daily life as a developer. It kinda feels like a super power, doesn't it?</p>
          <p>3. Software engineers are one of the most in-demand professionals. There is a vast market for them with excellent job opportunities and great salaries.</p>
          <p>4. It's a profession for those who, like me, are obsessed with finding solutions to challenging practical problems.</p>
          <p>5. It's also one of the most suitable profession for home-office jobs, which is perfect for me, since I've chose to live far away from urban area and have a close to the nature lifestyle.</p>

        <h2>Why CS50?</h2>
        <div class="article-content">
          <p>I became aware of the CS50 course from seeing many programming professionals praising the course.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, Harvard is a worldwide renowned educational institution, so it seemed very obvious that an introductory course from them would be an excellent starting point.</p>
          <p>As I was looking for a reliable introductory course in order to learn basic computer science concepts, I've decided to watch their first lecture (week 0), and it was something like love at first sight. I mean, the course has been the best educational experience I've ever had.</p>

      <h2>My Next Steps:</h2>
      <div class="article-content">
        <p>After I finish the CS50 course I'm planning on take a web development course, since I believe the fron-end programming is very beginner friendly and high demand on professionals.</p>
        <p>As a front-end web developer I'll work hard to build a consistent portfolio and get myself my very first job in this area. Then I'll keep learning and evolving to become a software engenieer.</p>
